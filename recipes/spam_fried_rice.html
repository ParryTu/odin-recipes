    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> Mmmh.. spam fried rice.. one of the easiesr and most delicious 
        dishes you can make at home for yourself and your family. This is the 
        perfect dish to use left over rice for a quick and simple dinner that the 
        kids will love!</p>

    <p> You can substitute spam for any other meat like ground beef, chicken,
        shrimp, or (my favorite) chinese sausage. There are no amounts to any
        of the ingredients here because people eat different amounts, and it's up
        to you to decide how much ingredients you would like to have.
