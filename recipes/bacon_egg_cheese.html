    <h1> Whopper

    </h1>

    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p> Wow, can it get any more classic than this? The iconic bacon, egg and cheese
        breakfast sandwich. It might sound simple to make but there's an art in making
        it that I've refined over the past few years of eating it. And I'd like to share
        it with you today.
    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>Roll/bread</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li> Eggs  </li>
        <li>  Cheese  </li>
        <li> Optional: Avocado </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan on medium high heat and add bacon. Cook to your liking and remove from pan.</li>
        <li>Drain the grease into a container to save for later. Place roll on greasy pan and toast.</li>
        <li> Plate roll on plate and add bacon. </li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon or two of saved grease back to pan. (If you're health conscious, add a little less or use a vegetable oil of your choice).</li>
        <li> Add eggs and cook to your liking (I cook mine fried). Remove pan from heat and add cheese on top of egg to melt. </li>
        <li> Add egg and cheese to sandwich. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Optional: Recently I've been adding a slice avocado to my bacon egg and cheeses and it has worked
            out pretty well. The smoothness compliments some of the sandwich's fried flavor. It goes to show
            that even though this recipe has been around for a while, there are still new developments
            in bacon egg and cheese crafting theory. Try something for yourself! Who knows, maybe 
            pineapple-bacon egg and cheese will be the way of 2022.
